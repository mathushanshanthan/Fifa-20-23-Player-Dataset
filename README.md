## Introduction

## Objective  
My objective was to clean and prepare the Data due to the raw data being very unorganised.  
I then moved on to finding insights about the data and elaborate them in the form of visualisations to demonstrate my key findings.

I have visualised:  
- Comparison of Messi / Ronaldo Attacking Finishing Over Time  
- Overall Player Rating Distribution  
- Top 10 Nationality Distribution of Players  
- Correlation Heatmap Between Player Attributes  
- Player Nationality Distribution on World Map  
- Average Overall vs Potentional Ratings  
  
I have also be implementing my own PREMIER LEAGUE SQUAD BUILDER algorithm that takes into account Budget, Formation and Overall Rating.
