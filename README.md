 The Dataset male_players_23.csv includes the available player data for the Fifa Career Mode from FIFA 20 to FIFA 23.The Dataset has a total of 3561639 different player entries with over 110 different attributes, resulting in 358,780,400 values being imported, inspected, cleaned, processed and visualised. Demonstrated use of Scatter Plots, Histograms, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Correlation Heatmap and GeoMaps. To finish of I have also implemented my own PREMIER LEAGUE SQUAD BUILDER algorithm that takes into account Budget, Formation and Overall Rating.
